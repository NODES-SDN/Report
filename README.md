SDN and Service chaining Report

Note to Aaron & Emad: Now the automatically created files are ignored in the commits. This also means that you will have to compile the source to get our report as .pfg or other format. I think this will be less of a trouble than solving merge conflicts all the time. Plus I think all of us are building and compiling the source quite regularly anyways.
